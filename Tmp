Can you help me build the design of admin cli tool for my team?
The target for building the tool according to my manager: "just making sure we agree on design before you make changes so that we can reduce iterations

sure but before you start lets please agree on a spec in the group chat

one command at a time works too

we dont have to spec everything out Hey Nihal, what do we mean by spec exactly?

what will the command look like

example

admin clear_data --tables --start --end [--condition] admin fill_ data -- what inputs/config to be supplied admin backfill

etc

there are lot of combinations on the commands we want to support and the options/config for each command

if we can arteculate that then building it out becomes really quick instead of building something and then making changes to fit the spec

since most of the code is pretty much ready in some shape or form

Also, they want that admin commands are independs and can be used by other admin command, so that the task will be generic and easy

So, if you get some context, then can you help me how can i proceed to buil tof the tool, i mean what could be the design
